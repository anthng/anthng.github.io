# Personalized Ranking System

The personalized ranking system is a ranked list of recommended items for a customer. The interesting point of personalized ranking is to revolve around positive examples (user has interacted with items, e.g: user bought items in the past), negative examples (the user has not interacted with the items, e.g: the user has not bought an item yet) - a mixture of negative feedback (the user is not interested in buying the item) and missing values (the user might buy the items in the future).

# 1. Introduction

Recommender systems are a widely applicable problem in industry such as: music recommendation, movie/video recommendation, point-of-interest (POI) recommendationm and so on. The goal of recommender systems is to provide relevant items based on historical data of users who interacted with them.

In general, most recent works in recommender system foccus on two scenarios:

- **Explicit feedback**: user provides explicit feedback, like: rating.
- **Implicit feedback**: user clicks/purchases/views times (interacts with).

For explicit feedback, not all systems can get explicit user data while implicit feedback is easy to collect because we can track automatically user interactions. In the real world, implicit feedback is already available in almost any information system â€“ e.g. web servers record any page access in log files.

In the implicit scenario, only positive classes are observed. Researchers used binary values to represent the implicit feedback, 1 means positive (observed), while 0 means negative (non-observed). In the other words, if there exists an interaction between user and item, they are labeled a positive (1), and the others are labeled as negative (0).

However as mentioned above, the negative cases (non-observed) are a mixture of negative feedback (not interested in) and missing values (potential buyers). Thus, this approach will not take into account ranking recommendation in the future.

In this paper, Rendle et al. propose a different way to represent the implicit feedback by using item pairs as training data and optimize the rank list using Bayesian probability.
